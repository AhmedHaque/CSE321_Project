# Health Monitoring System
## Desciption
- Two sensors will take in the heartbeat and temperature and once the data has been read, it will send out a signal that will light up either red or green based on whether the user is healthy or not. If the client has inconsistent heartbeats, the LED will blink red. If the client has a high or low temperature, then the LED will blink green.
